<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student (2024–) at the College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum (East China), under the supervision of <a href='http://chenglizhaochen.cn/'>Prof. Chenglizhao Chen</a>. 
I received my previous training in computer vision and industrial AI, with my early research and engineering work focusing on visual anomaly detection using multi-view industrial camera setups, through which I completed multiple real-world industrial product deployments.

Recently, my research interests have shifted toward embodied AI, focusing on the integration of 3D geometric vision, active sensing, and robotic interaction to enable robust perception and decision-making in complex real-world industrial environments.

Any form of collaboration is welcome. Please feel free to contact me via email (yuanshaojiang001@163.com; bz24070009@s.upc.edu.cn).

  **Surface Defect Detection of Highly Reflective Leather Based on Dual-Mask-Guided Deep-Learning Model**  

  **Shaojiang Yuan**, Li Li, Hao Chen, Xian Li

  *IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement(TIM), 2023*  

  [paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10234460)

  We propose a method that effectively removes specular highlights while preserving bright defects for accurate defect detection on highly reflective surfaces.
